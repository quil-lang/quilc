;; this routine emits pretty efficient (but perhaps not optimal) decompositions
;; of certain FORKED gates. the input ingredients are:
;;
;;   + an parametric family G(theta) satisfying G(theta) G(phi) = G(theta + phi)
;;   + a gate F with the property F G(theta) = G(-theta) F
;;
;; given these two things, the gate
;; 
;;   FORKED G(theta, phi) control target
;; 
;; can be implemented in terms of G
;; and CONTROLLED F by an averaging scheme:
;;
;;   G((theta + phi) / 2) target
;;   # depending on the value of the control qubit, this next sequence will sum
;;   # with the above application of G to give either G(theta) or G(phi)
;;   CONTROLLED F         control target
;;   G((theta - phi) / 2) target
;;   CONTROLLED DAGGER F  control target
;;
;; as a special case of this, we may set G = RY or G = RZ to recover "uniformly
;; controlled rolls" (UCRs), which appear in many common decomposition schemes
;; of generic unitaries, and so are highly compilation-relevant. they are also
;; highly hardware-relevant, because we can take CONTROLLED F = CNOT to get
;; native output on common devices. the function UCR-COMPILER below implements
;; the above scheme in this specific case.
;;
;; REM: this kind of decomposition scheme is especially relevant because of
;;      the observation that for a general multiplexed operator U0 (+) U1 acting
;;      on n qubits can be written an (n-1)Q operator VL, an (n-1)-FORKED RZ,
;;      and a second (n-1)Q operator VR.
;;
;;      for a scheme leveraging this idea, see src/compilers/qs-compile.lisp .
;;
;; REM: the decomposition of FORKED into CONTROLLED gates above can also be done
;;      in a slightly different order:
;;
;;   CONTROLLED F         control target
;;   G((theta - phi) / 2) target
;;   CONTROLLED F         control target
;;   G((theta + phi) / 2) target
;;
;;      applied judiciously, we can use both of these decompositions in tandem
;;      to place two CONTROLLED F instances next to each other in a recursive
;;      decomposition. in previous iterations of quilc, this was referred to as
;;      "chirality" and was implemented using non-local state; in the present
;;      incarnation of UCR-COMPILER, we do this interleaving purely locally.
;;
;;      *without interleaving the two decompositions*, the F-count of this
;;      decomposition routine satisfies r(n) = 2 + 2*r(n-1), and with the
;;      interleaving it is reduced by roughly a factor of 2.
;;
;; REM: we also provide an variant implementation of this scheme using ISWAP,
;;      which decomposes
;;
;;   FORKED RY(-phi, phi) control target
;;
;;      as
;;
;;   ISWAP control target
;;   RX(phi) control
;;   ISWAP control target
;;   Z control
;;   Z target
;;
;;      what's in use here is the decomposition of SWAP into ISWAP + CNOT,
;;      solving for CNOT, and commuting the SWAPs (and local gates) past the
;;      inner RX to convert it to an RY and change it from the target to the
;;      control qubit.  with this in hand, the decomposition scheme is much
;;      the same.
