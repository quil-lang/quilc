;;; Alright, so here's the deal with alignment.
;;;
;;; All memory allocations (not accesses!) must be aligned, *except
;;; for BITs*. What this means is that the physical address of the
;;; start of every non-BIT allocation must be a multiple of ALIGNMENT
;;; BITs. If you OFFSET by some number of BITs that isn't a multiple,
;;; it will error! It is up to the programmer to get alignment
;;; correct. (The rationale for not rounding up is this: If we round
;;; up, then aliasing behavior can silently change if alignment
;;; changes. It's better to fail more than to be inconsistent.)
;;;
;;; Consider yourself spooked.
;;;
;;; If you want to ensure every *access* is aligned, then the
;;; following must be true:
;;;
;;;     * Your alignment should divide the size of your REAL and
;;;       INTEGER types.
;;;
;;;     * If your alignment is greater than 8 bits, you must not
;;;       access OCTETs.
;;;
;;; It's pretty reasonable to assume any architecture will have an
;;; alignment of 8 bits. A 1-bit aligned architecture is totally
;;; free. Every access is valid. Some architectures might have an
;;; alignment of greater than 8 bits (e.g., 32 or 64 bits).
;;;
;;; BIT is special, and in hardware, would be implemented with special
;;; primitives.
