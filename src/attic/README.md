# Attic

This directory contains old files which were maybe useful at one time
that aren't in use (or loaded) by the system.

They may be resurrected (or may be deleted), and may have pedagogical
use as reading material.

## scheduling.lisp

Contains primitives for working with "events" and "timelines". Mostly
follows Robert's scheduling paper and his March Meeting presentation.

## schedule.lisp

Contains an implementation of black-box scheduling.
