;;;; This file contains a macro WITH-INST for constructing lists of
;;;; Quil instructions. Originally this was written to support
;;;; DEFINE-COMPILER, but is useful more generally.

(in-package #:cl-quil.frontend)

;;; Within the dynamic extent of a DEFINE-COMPILER, we publish
;;; instructions to output using a DEFINE-VOP-like INST macro, and we
;;; quit a compiler early using FINISH-COMPILER.

;;; Special variable private to WITH-INST. Within the context of
;;; WITH-INST, it will be bound to a cons (LIST . TAIL).
