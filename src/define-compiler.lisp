;;;; The bulk of this file concerns itself with syntactic sugar for

;;;; The main use of these routines is to support `define-compiler`, which does
;;;; a lot of clever destructuring of its arguments.

;;; in what follows, we're very interested in two kinds of maps keyed on bindings:
;;;  + an "occurrence table" is valued in integers, and it counts frequency.
;;;    this comes up when describing the output of a given compiler: in order to
;;;    discern whether it's making progress against some reference target gateset,
;;;    it's important to count what sorts of things it's emitting and how many.
;;;  + a "gate set" is valued in GATE-RECORD objects, and it tracks e.g. fidelity.
;;;    this comes up when trying to discern which of two possible "legal" outputs
;;;    is preferable: when two (chains of) compilers emit instruction sequences
;;;    that belong to some target gateset, we want to be able to tell, based on
;;;    a fine-grained understanding of the emitted sequences, which is more likely
;;;    to perform better on hardware. GATE-RECORDs track this performance info.

FULL-CONTEXT: Names a symbol to which the active COMPILATION-CONTEXT will be bound.

CHIP-SPECIFICATION: Names a symbol to which the active CHIP-SPECIFICATION will be bound.

GATESET-REDUCER: When NIL, this compiler is filtered from participation in compression. Defaults to T.

CLASS: The compiler constructed by DEFINE-COMPILER will be of the specified subclass of COMPILER.

PERMIT-BINDING-MISMATCHES-WHEN: A predicate that, when true, permits the compiler to skip equality matching during gate destructuring.  For instance, this can be used to allow approximate matches.

OUTPUT-GATESET: A plist keyed on arguments to MAKE-GATE-BINDING with values in frequency count.  If specified supplants DEFINE-COMPILER's automatic estimation of the gate production of the compiler routine."
