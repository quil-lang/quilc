  "An individual rewriting rule for use by the compressor.

READABLE-NAME is a string used to identify the rewriting rule during debugging.

COUNT is an integer that specifies the number of adjacent instructions the rule takes as input.
 
CONSUMER is a function that consumes a COMPRESSOR-CONTEXT followed by a list of instructions.  Its possible results are:
   * The error condition COMPILER-DOES-NOT-APPLY if the rule is inapplicable.
   * a LIST of instructions if the rule applies.
   * Some other error condition if compilation unexpectedly fails."

READABLE-NAME is an evaluated parameter that should result in a STRING.

CONTEXT-VAR should be a symbol that will be bound to a context, or the symbol _ should it be ignored.

BINDING-CLAUSES is a list of bindings, as if by OPERATOR-MATCH. Specifically, it has the following grammar:

    <BINDING-CLAUSES> ::= (<MATCH-CLAUSE> <VARIABLE>)
    <MATCH-CLAUSE>    ::= (<GATE-NAME> (<PARAM>*) <QUBIT> <QUBIT>*)
    <GATE-NAME>       ::= <STRING>
    <PARAM>           ::= <VARIABLE> | <FLOAT>
    <QUBIT>           ::= <VARIABLE> | <INTEGER>
    <VARIABLE>        ::= <SYMBOL> | _           ; symbol will be bound in BODY

BODY is a list of forms that, by the end, should construct a list of instructions, should the rule succeed. It might use CONTEXT-VAR to help decide what instructions to produce. (BODY is free to GIVE-UP-COMPILATION as well.)"
