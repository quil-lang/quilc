;;; Standard Waveform Definitions
;;;
;;; PULSE and CAPTURE instructions require the specification of an appropriate
;;; waveform to use. Waveforms come in two flavors.
;;;   - "Standard" waveforms are baked-in to the language, and supported by downstream
;;;     consumers. These are represented by a subclass of STANDARD-WAVEFORM. Each
;;;     instance has a well-specified duration, which is part of the waveform parameters.
;;;   - Custom waveforms, which are associated with a DEFWAVEFORM definition. These
;;;     are ultimately specifications for a fixed-length sequence of IQ values. They may
;;;     be parametric, but their duration is the sequence length * sample rate.
;;;
;;; This file gives the definitions of the standard waveforms, together with the required
;;; information to construct an appropriate instance from a  quilt waveform reference.
