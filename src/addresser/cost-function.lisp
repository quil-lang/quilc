;;;; cost-function.lisp

;;;; Author: Eric Peterson
;;;;
;;;; This file provides the function cost-function that is used to compare SWAP
;;;; choices by do-greedy-temporal-addressing. the current scheme is to weight a
;;;; given logical-to-physical addressing configuration by how far some set of
;;;; instructions (typically: the next ones available for scheduling) are from
;;;; being physically instantiable, where for each such instruction we count the
;;;; time it will take to SWAP them into place along the shortest path.
;;;;
;;;; there are some subtleties to this: given a pair of instructions like
;;;; CZ 0 3
;;;; CZ 3 7
;;;; on a chip with a linear circuit topology, and (for whatever reason) assuming
;;;; qubits 0 and 7 to be fixed, a naive sum of the SWAP distances will result
;;;; in a standstill. the 0-3 distance is 2 SWAPs and the 3-7 distance is 3 SWAPs,
;;;; and trading 3 for 2 or 3 for 4 preserves the total number of 1+4 = 3+2 = 5
;;;; SWAPs in all. to break this kind of deadlock, we make very distant gates
;;;; suffer a decay penalty, so that gates that are already nearer are preferred
;;;; and executed first.
