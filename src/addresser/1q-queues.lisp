;;; 1Q Queue Management
;;;
;;; The addresser optionally (cf. *ADDRESSER-USE-1Q-QUEUES*) prevents 1Q
;;; operations from influencing anything (qubit allocation, SWAP placement, and
;;; so on) since 1Q operations can be easily moved around and are often not very
;;; costly.
;;;
;;; This is done via a system of "1Q Queues", which stash the 1Q operations
;;; during addressing and then are flushed at appropriate times.
