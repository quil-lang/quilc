;;; This file contains the temporal addresser, which solves the problem
;;; of mapping a sequence of Quil instructions acting on logical qubits
;;; to a scheduled sequence of Quil instructions acting on physical qubits.
;;;
;;; Logical qubits are agnostic of any particular QPU. In particular, incoming
;;; Quil programs may presuppose a certain connectivity that does not exist (or
;;; is suboptimal) on a specific chip. Physical qubits are meaningful with
;;; respect to a given chip specification, and one of the responsibilities of
;;; the addesser is to manage the rewiring of logical to physical qubits,
;;; introducing SWAP instructions as needed to allow for the appropriate
;;; connectivity.
;;;
;;; As a very toy example, consider the following logical instruction
;;;
;;;  CNOT 0 4
;;;
;;; with the chip topology given by this diagram
;;;
;;;         (1)
;;;        /   \
;;;      (0)   (2)--(4)
;;;        \   /
;;;         (3)
;;;
;;; Supposing for a brief moment that the chip supports CNOT and SWAP
;;; operations on adjacent physical qubits, the instruction CNOT 0 2
;;; could be translated to
;;;
;;;   SWAP 0 1
;;;   SWAP 1 2
;;;   CNOT 2 4
;;;   SWAP 1 2
;;;   SWAP 0 1
;;;
;;; In this particular example, the presence of the path (0)--(1)--(2)
;;; from physical qubit 0 to a qubit adjacent to 4 is what enabled
;;; this particular sequence of SWAPs. It is one of the responsibilities of the
;;; temporal addresser to identify such paths, and insert the corresponding
;;; SWAP operations. Among the many candidate paths, it must choose
;;; a preferred one according to some heuristic, such as A* (with weights
;;; coming from timing or fidelity data).
;;;
;;; A second responsibility of the addresser is to augment the provided
;;; Quil instructions with timing information, relative to their execution
;;; on a physical device. This information is managed by a chip schedule.
;;;
;;; See DO-GREEDY-TEMPORAL-ADDRESSING below for the main entry point.
