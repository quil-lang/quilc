;;; This file implements utilities for creating a Hasse Diagram for a
;;; logical-schedule instance. The resulting diagram indicates the
;;; partial ordering of the instructions. The diagram is in the form
;;; of a Graphviz source file, called a "dot file", conventionally
;;; named with file type ending ".gv".

;;; The dot file can be readily transformed into various kinds of
;;; image files. Given a file such as "example-1.gv", it can be
;;; converted to various viewable formats and then viewed in numerous
;;; possible ways. Here are some example command lines that should
;;; work on any sort Linux or MacOS with Graphviz installed. (Note
;;; that 'dot' is the Graphviz program for drawing directed graphs.)
;;;
;;;   dot -Tpdf example-1.gv -o g.pdf
;;;     -- convert the dot file to a PDF file named "g.pdf"
;;;
;;;   dot -Tpng example-1.gv -o g.png
;;;      -- convert the dot file to a PNG file named "g.png"
;;;
;;; The resulting image file can then be shown in various software,
;;; such as image viewers, PDF viewers, and web browsers.

;;;; Design Questions

;;; Should there be other forms of output such as some kind of
;;; graphics in SLIME.  Should there be integration with SLIME and/or
;;; (plain) Emacs?

;;; Labels: currently, as each node is created it is assigned a label,
;;; which is simply the source text of the instruction (which may not
;;; be unique), and a unique label name, which is made up of the label
;;; text followed by a monotically increasing integer. This ensures
;;; that node is unique to the resulting graph, which is required,
;;; since each instruction represents a unique node, whereas the label
;;; text may be duplicated any number of times, just as any
;;; instruction may be duplicated multiple times in a quil program.
;;;
;;; There may be other good options to consider for labels. It's
;;; doubtful you would want the label name to show up (the label plus
;;; unique integer), since it is a randomish artifact of the graph
;;; search order, but conceivably you might want that for debugging
;;; (of this tool).  Are there other good options to consider for
;;; numbering?
;;;
;;; One appealing idea would be to show the line number of the
;;; instruction in the original listing. However, (a) we do not have
;;; access to the original source listing from the logical scheduler
;;; and therefore do not have access to line numbers from the logical
;;; scheduler; and (b) there may be more than one instruction per
;;; line, so what do you do then, subnumbering (10.3, etc.)?
;;;
;;; Another possibility would be an encoding of the form
;;; depth.position, where depth is the distance from the Hasse root
;;; (bottom), and position is a position (from left to right, say) in
;;; the horizontal span. One bit of hair to consider with that: it
;;; seems the left-to-right positioning in the horizontal span is left
;;; up to Graphviz, so how can you know that?  You could just order
;;; them effectively semi-randomly at each level, much as we do now,
;;; and users may not mind the order not being perfect.
;;;
;;; On the other hand, it may be possible to create really helpful
;;; visualization if the diagram combined with the program listing and
;;; integrated fully. That probably requires diagrammer to have access
;;; to both the logical scheduler and the parse (and possibly also the
;;; information about the source code).





;;;; Higher-Level Functions

;;; Here the exported functions: write-hasse-for-logical-schedule and
;;; write-hasse-for-quil. Both put out a Hasse diagram as a Graphviz
;;; dot file (.gv). The former takes a logical scheduler (optionally
;;; with a program, which may improve the output), while the latter
;;; takes a quil program, for which a logical schedule is then
;;; derived.
