OBJECTS is an array. In its nth position, there is a vector of order n hardware objects on the chip.

GENERIC-COMPILERS is a vector of functions used as fallback compilation methods, applied when a hardware object does not exist or when a hardware object's compilation methods all fail.  The order of this array is important: compilers earlier in the array are preferentially applied over compilers later in the array.

GENERIC-REWRITING-RULES is a similar vector of REWRITING-RULE structures that the compressor loop can use to generate shorter gate strings when rules specialized to local hardware objects have been exhausted.  Again, the array is sorted by descending preference.

LOOKUP-CACHE is a hash table mapping lists of qubit indices to hardware objects.  It gets auto-populated by `WARM-CHIP-SPEC-LOOKUP-CACHE'. This should not be accessed directly; use `LOOKUP-HARDWARE-ADDRESS-BY-QUBITS'."

;;; The HARDWARE object structure stores a lot of information. It
;;; serves many purposes, principally to solve some of the following
;;; problems:
;;;
;;;     1. To address operations on qubits, qubit pairs, qubit
;;;     triplets, etc. This requires determining a notion of
;;;     _occupancy_ of resources.
;;;
;;;     2. To determine what options are available for compiling
;;;     operations on that resource.
;;;
;;; The first point is particularly important. You should *not* use
;;; CXNS to determine directed connectivity. (By "directed", we mean
;;; anything to do with what operations are allowed.) CXNS just
;;; encodes some physical relationships on physical hardware;
;;; collections of resources on which a variety of operations can
;;; possibly act.
;;;
;;; To determine available instructions, their validity, etc., the
;;; information in NATIVE-INSTRUCTIONS and MISC-DATA (namely the
;;; duration table) are helpful.
;;;
;;; Now for some miscellaneous comments about the design.

;;; some design decisions about CXNS:
;;; + easy to iterate over the objects in positions above ORDER and know when to terminate
;;; + easy to iterate over the objects in positions below ORDER and know when to terminate
;;; + easy to tell when there are no objects in any given position
;;;
;;; using an array to do this sometimes means some obnoxious array index safety,
;;; which we wouldn't experience if we were using e.g. a hash-table, but in trade
;;; we would have a harder time asking for the half of the keys that were below
;;; our order. maybe there is a more intelligent data structure to use. something
;;; to think about in the future.
;;;
;;; We NOTINLINE here because a previous file "compilation-methods.lisp" uses this
;;; structure, but the dependency is circular, so moving this doesn't make much sense.

GATE-INFORMATION is a hash table mapping gate bindings to GATE-RECORD objects.

COMPILATION-METHODS is a vector of compilers that can be employed to convert non-native instructions to native ones, sorted in descending order of precedence. An individual method receives an instruction and an environment (typically a PARSED-PROGRAM). The same method returns a list of instructions if successful and NIL if unsuccessful.  This slot is typically populated by WARM-HARDWARE-OBJECTS.

PERMUTATION-GATES is a vector of permutation gates that this device can natively compile, stored as PERMUTATION-RECORD structs. This data is used by the event scheduler.

REWRITING-RULES is a vector of compilers that the compressor loop can use to generate shorter gate strings.  This slot is typically populated by WARM-HARDWARE-OBJECTS.

CXNS is an array. In its nth position, there is a vector of the order n hardware objects on the chip that are connected to this one. Among other things, this is used to determine shared resource blocking.
