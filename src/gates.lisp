;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Gate Protocol ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; Every gate represents a unitary operation. As such, every gate
;;; should be representable as a fully dense matrix acting on a
;;; particular qubit subsystem. This function accesses/constructs that
;;; representation.
;;;
;;; We don't implement the gate protocol on GATE-DEFINITION instances
;;; to avoid errors and costly performance penalties.
