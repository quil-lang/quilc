  "Runs a full compiler pass on a parsed-program object.

Arguments:

  - PARSED-PROGRAM: The parsed program to compile

  - CHIP-SPECIFICATION: The chip specification describing the target chip

Keyword arguments:

  - PROTOQUIL: Whether the input and output programs should conform to protoquil restrictions

  - REWIRING-TYPE: The scheme by which logical qubits are mapped (rewired) to physical qubits

  - DESTRUCTIVE: Default NIL. If T, the input program is mutated and after compilation contains the compiled program. Otherwise, a copy is made of the input program and the compiled copy is returned. Note that for large programs you may prefer to mutate the original program rather than waste time copying it. For example, the server interface will mutate the program since it has no use for the unmolested original program after compilation.
