;;; A compilation method is a function with inputs
;;;   * a resolved gate-application object
;;;
;;;   * keyword arguments that further specialize the behavior of the
;;;     method and outputs a list of Quil instructions which encode
;;;     the matrix up to global phase
;;;
;;;   OR the signal of (a subcondition of) COMPILER-DOES-NOT-APPLY,
;;;      which means that the supplied instruction is cannot or
;;;      "should" not be compiled with this method. The preferred
;;;      method for signalling a condition is calling
;;;      GIVE-UP-COMPILATION, so that other quilc authors have the
;;;      opportunity to install more complicated error handling.
;;;
;;;   OR an error, which means that the compilation routine
;;;      experienced an error.
;;;
;;; Compilation methods should bring you *closer* to some desired
;;; output. If it doesn't, or if it can't, one of these conditions
;;; should be signalled.
