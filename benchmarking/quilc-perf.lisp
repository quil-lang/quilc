;;; This module has benchmarking tools primarily to detect performance
;;; bottlenecks as the number of qubits (nQ, hereafter) increases.
;;;
;;; We provide a few kinds of chips and Quil programs and several
;;; methods of benchmarking as a function of nQ.
;;;
;;; The chip types: :fully-connected, :linear 
;;;
;;; The program types:
;;;
;;;   :static - a small rather trivial Quil program, namely:
;;;
;;;       H 0; CNOT 2 0; H 1; CNOT 0 1; X 0
;;;
;;;     Note that the program is the same (static) no matter the value
;;;     of nQ.
;;;
;;;   :bell - the result of (qvm-app::bell-program nQ)
;;;
;;;   :qft - the result of (qvm-app::qft-program nQ)
;;;
;;;   :hadamard - the result of (qvm-app::hadamard-program nQ)

;;; BENCHMARK-NQ: run the default series of nQ values on all the chip
;;; types for all the program types, printing out results on
;;; *standard-output* as CSV lines in two forms: (1) raw timings (in
;;; seconds) and (2) max-of-series style.
