Quilc is an advanced optimizing compiler for the quantum instruction
language Quil, licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE.txt).

Quilc comprises two projects. The first, `cl-quil`, does the heavy
lifting of parsing, compiling, and optimizing Quil code. The second,
`quilc`, presents an external interface for using `cl-quil`, either using
the binary `quilc` application directly, or alternatively by
communicating with an [RPCQ](https://github.com/rigetti/rpcq/) server.

Quil is the [quantum instruction language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03355.pdf) developed at
[Rigetti Computing](https://rigetti.com). In Quil quantum algorithms are expressed using Quil's
standard gates and instructions. One can also use Quil's `DEFGATE` to
define new non-standard gates, and `DEFCIRCUIT` to build a named circuit
that can be referenced elsewhere in Quil code (analogous to a function
in most other programming languages).

## Quil Compiler

This directory contains the `quilc` application. `quilc` takes as input
arbitrary Quil code, either provided directly to the binary or to the
`quilc` server, and produces optimized Quil code. The compiled code is
optimized for the configured instruction set architecture (ISA),
targeting the native gates specified by the ISA.


### Cloning the repository

To clone the quilc repository and its bundled submodules, run the following command:

``` shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rigetti/quilc.git
```

### Building the Quil Compiler

Prerequisites to building `quilc` are:

1. Standard UNIX build tools
2. [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org/) (a recent version, but [*not* SBCL 1.5.6](#sbcl-156)): Common Lisp compiler
3. [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/): Common Lisp library manager
4. [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software): Messaging library
   required by RPCQ. Development headers are required at build time.

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/rigetti/qvm/blob/master/doc/lisp-setup.md)
to get started from scratch.

One notorious dependency is [MAGICL](https://github.com/rigetti/magicl). It is available on Quicklisp,
but requires you to install some system libraries such as BLAS, LAPACK, and libffi. Follow MAGICL's
instructions carefully before proceeding with loading CL-QUIL or `make`ing quilc.

Once these dependencies are installed, building should be easy. Building the `quilc`
binary is automated using the `Makefile`:

``` shell
$ make quilc
```

This will create a binary `quilc` in the current directory

``` shell
$ ./quilc --version
```

To install system-wide issue the command

``` shell
$ make install
```

### Using the Quil Compiler

The Quil Compiler provides two modes of interaction: (1) communicating
directly with the `quilc` binary, providing your Quil code over `stdin`;
or (2) communicating with the `quilc` server.

#### quilc

The `quilc` binary reads Quil code provided on `stdin`:

``` shell
$ echo H 0 | quilc
$ cat large_file.quil | quilc
```

#### Server

For various reasons (e.g. not having to repeatedly load the `quilc`
binary into memory, communicating over a network) `quilc` provides a
an [RPCQ](https://github.com/rigetti/rpcq/) server
interface. [RPCQ](https://github.com/rigetti/rpcq/) is an open-source
RPC framework developed at Rigetti for efficient network communication
through the QCS stack. The server is started in RPCQ-mode using the
`-R` flag

```

```

The server-mode provides to high-level languages such as Python a way
to communicate with the Quil compiler, thus enabling high-level
abstractions and tools that are not directly available in Quil. The
[`pyquil`](https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil) library provides such an interface to `quilc`.

## CL-QUIL

`CL-QUIL` is the Lisp library that implements parsing and compiling
of Quil code. The code can be found under `./src/`. Other lisp libraries, including
`quilc`, can depend on it.

### Usage

To get up and running quickly using the `quilc` Docker image, head directly to the
section "Running the Quil Compiler with Docker" below. Otherwise, the following steps
will walk you through how to build the compiler from source.

Follow the instructions in QVM's
[doc/lisp-setup.md](https://github.com/rigetti/qvm/blob/master/doc/lisp-setup.md) to satisfy the
dependencies required to load the `CL-QUIL` library. Afterwhich, the
library can be loaded


``` shell
$ sbcl

```

``` common-lisp
* (ql:quickload :cl-quil)
;;; <snip>compilation output</snip>
(:CL-QUIL)
* (cl-quil:parse-quil "H 0")
#<CL-QUIL:PARSED-PROGRAM {100312C643}>
```

A few good entry points to exploring the library are:

* The functions `cl-quil::parse-quil` in [`src/parser.lisp`](src/parser.lisp), and
  `cl-quil:parse-quil` in [`src/cl-quil.lisp`](src/cl-quil.lisp) and the various
  transforms therein.
* The function `cl-quil:compiler-hook` which constructs a control-flow
  graph (CFG) and then performs various optimizations on the CFG.

## Automated Build, Test, and Release with Docker

The CI pipeline for `quilc` produces a Docker image, available at
[`rigetti/quilc`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rigetti/quilc).
To get the latest stable version of `quilc`, run `docker pull rigetti/quilc`.
To instead pull a specific version of quilc, run `docker pull rigetti/quilc:VERSION`,
where `VERSION` is something like `1.10.4`.

The Dockerfile for quilc builds from three parent Docker images:

1. [`rigetti/lisp`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rigetti/lisp): Contains SBCL, Quicklisp, and
   third-party libraries.
2. [`rigetti/rpcq`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rigetti/rpcq): Contains the message spec and
   RPC framework used by quilc.
3. [`rigetti/qvm`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rigetti/qvm): Contains the Quantum Virtual Machine,
   used in the quilc tests.

The Dockerfile for quilc intentionally pins the versions of these three images,
which means that the version numbers must be actively incremented as necessary.
If the build for quilc is failing, this is probably the place to look, because
the unit tests are run inside of a freshly-built quilc Docker image as part of
the GitLab CI pipeline.

## Running the Quil Compiler with Docker

As outlined above, the Quil Compiler supports two modes of operation: stdin and server.

To run `quilc` in stdin mode, do one either of the following:

1. The containerized compiler will then read whatever newline-separated Quil instructions you
enter, waiting for an EOF signal (Control+d) to compile it.

```shell
docker run --rm -it rigetti/quilc
```

2. You can alternatively pipe Quil instructions into the `quilc` container if you drop the `-t`.

```shell
echo H 0 | docker run --rm -i rigetti/quilc
```

To run `quilc` in server mode, do the following:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -p 5555:5555 rigetti/quilc -R
```

This will spawn an RPCQ-mode `quilc` server, that you can communicate with over TCP. If
you would like to change the port of the server to PORT, you can alter the command as follows:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -p PORT:PORT rigetti/quilc -R -p PORT
```

Ports 5555 and 6000 are exposed using the EXPOSE directive in the `rigetti/quilc` image, so
you can additionally use the `-P` option to automatically bind these container ports to randomly
assigned host ports. You can then inspect the mapping using `docker port CONTAINER [PORT]`.

## Release Process

1. Update `VERSION.txt` and push the commit to `master`.
2. Push a git tag `vX.Y.Z` that contains the same version number as in `VERSION.txt`.
3. Verify that the resulting build (triggered by pushing the tag) completes successfully.
4. Publish a [release](https://github.com/rigetti/quilc/releases) using the tag as the name.
5. Close the [milestone](https://github.com/rigetti/quilc/milestones) associated with this release,
   and migrate incomplete issues to the next one.
6. Update the quilc version of downstream dependencies (if applicable, see next section).

## Downstream Dependencies

Currently, there are a couple different components of the Forest SDK that depend on quilc:

1. [qvm](https://github.com/rigetti/qvm)
2. [pyquil](https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil)
3. [forest-benchmarking](https://github.com/rigetti/forest-benchmarking)

It is the responsibility of the releaser to verify that the latest quilc release does not
break the test suites of these downstream dependencies. All of these repositories pull the
latest released version of quilc as part of their CI pipelines.

# Incompatible software versions

## SBCL 1.5.6

There is [an issue](https://github.com/rigetti/quilc/issues/401) with
SBCL 1.5.6 that results in unhandled memory faults in
`SB-VM::FUNCALLABLE-INSTANCE-TRAMP` when attempting to run quilc
compiled with that version of SBCL. The issue was resolved with SBCL
commit
[550c4d2](https://sourceforge.net/p/sbcl/sbcl/ci/550c4d23c77cc670fb95d7216e3c6d493bbd76eb/). For
this reason, it's not possible to use quilc or cl-quil with SBCL
1.5.6, but any other recent SBCL version should work fine.
