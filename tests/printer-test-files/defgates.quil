# Input
# Disable fixed-point check

# The expected output for this input is as given in the Output section, below. However, if *that*
# output is parsed, it will be correctly recognized as a permutation matrix, and then the printed
# representation will be a "DEFGATE R as PERMUTATION" not a "DEFGATE R", hence we disable the
# fixed-point check for this input.

DEFGATE TEST-NOT-FIXED-POINT:
    exp(i*0), 0
    0, exp(0/i)

TEST-NOT-FIXED-POINT 0

# Output
DEFGATE TEST-NOT-FIXED-POINT:
    1.0, 0.0
    0.0, 1.0


TEST-NOT-FIXED-POINT 0

# Input

# If we modify the DEFGATE from the previous Input section slightly so that it's no longer a
# permutation matrix, then the output passes the fixed-point check.

DEFGATE TEST-FIXED-POINT:
    exp(i*0), 0
    1, exp(0/i)

TEST-FIXED-POINT 0

# Output
DEFGATE TEST-FIXED-POINT:
    1.0, 0.0
    1.0, 1.0


TEST-FIXED-POINT 0
