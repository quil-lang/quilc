Runs a GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) experiment:
Players A, B, and C are given the state
|000>-|011>-|101>-|110>,
as well as bits a,b,c (a=b=1 and c=0 in this example).
Their goal is to output bits x,y,z respectively such
that x+y+z(mod 2) = a OR b OR c, under the promise that
a+b+c=0(mod 2).  In contrast to the classical case, there
exists a quantum strategy that always succeeds: each
player measures in the standard basis if his bit is 0,
or in the Hadamard basis if his bit is 1, then outputs
whatever he observes.  When this program is run, the
outcomes of the 3 measurements should be uniformly random
conditioned on having parity=1.
