Uses Simon's algorithm to learn about the "hidden
shift" of a function f (the string s such that
f(x)=f(y) if and only if y=x+s, where + denotes
bitwise XOR).  The function is the following
linear map from 5 bits to 4 bits:
f(a,b,c,d,e)=(a+b,b+c,c+d,d+e)
Clearly s=11111 for this function.
The program first prepares a uniform superposition
over 5-bit strings in qubits 0 to 4.  It then
computes f in qubits 5 to 8, and measures those
qubits "for pedagogical purposes."  Finally it
performs a Fourier transform on qubits 0 to 4 and
measures them.  The first round of measurements
should produce a random 4-bit string; the second
should produce a random 5-bit string y such that
y*s=0 (that is, y has even parity).
