Uses the Bennett-Wiesner dense quantum coding
protocol to transmit 2 classical bits using 1
EPR pair and 1 bit of quantum communication.
You can specify the bits to be transmitted at
the command line by typing
chp densecoding zz	for 00
chp densecoding zZ	for 01
chp densecoding Zz	for 10
chp densecoding ZZ	for 11
These will be stored in qubits 0 and 1.
The program first prepares an EPR pair across
qubits 2 and 3 (2 is Alice's half and 3 is Bob's
half).  Alice then applies unitaries to her half
of the EPR pair depending on qubits 0 and 1.
Next, Alice's half is transferred to qubit 4,
which represents the 1 bit of quantum
communication to Bob.  Finally, Bob applies
unitaries to his qubits (4 and 3), and then
measures them to read Alice's message.
