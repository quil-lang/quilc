;;; PARSING "GOLDEN" TEST FILES
;;;
;;; A golden file is a file that contains one or more alternating input and output sections, where
;;; each input section contains text meant to be passed to some function under test, and each output
;;; section corresponds to the expected output for the preceding input. Input sections start with a
;;; line containing the string "# Input" and likewise output sections begin with "# Output". For
;;; example:
;;;
;;; ----------- begin golden.txt ------------
;;; # Input
;;; DEFGATE TEST(%arg):
;;;     COS(%arg)^2, 0
;;;     0, SIN(%arg)^2
;;;
;;; TEST(0.5) 0
;;; # Output
;;; DEFGATE TEST(%arg):
;;;     (COS(%arg)^(2.0)), 0.0
;;;     0.0, (SIN(%arg)^(2.0))
;;;
;;;
;;; TEST(0.5) 0
;;;
;;; ----------- end golden.txt ------------
;;;
;;; In this example, both the input and output sections contain Quil code, but the golden file
;;; parser does not attribute any meaning to the contents of the sections. Any text between the
;;; section headers, including blank lines, is collected and returned.
;;;
;;; Golden files are useful for testing any function or system that can take text as input and
;;; produces text as output. See TEST-PRINT-PARSED-PROGRAM-GOLDEN-FILES in printer-tests.lisp for
;;; example usage.
;;;
;;;
;;; A NOTE ON TRAILING NEWLINES
;;;
;;; The final newline in an input or output section is considered part of the golden file syntax,
;;; and therefore not included in the input/output text returned for that section. Thus, if you want
;;; your input/output to include a trailing newline, then you need to add a trailing blank line to
;;; the section text. For example, given the following file:
;;;
;;; ----------- begin no-trailing-newline.txt ------------
;;; # Input
;;; Input 1
;;; # Output
;;; Output 1
;;; # Input
;;; Input 2
;;; # Output
;;; Output 2
;;; ----------- end no-trailing-newline.txt ------------
;;;
;;; calling (parse-golden-file "no-trailing-newline.txt") will return
;;;
;;;     (#S(CL-QUIL-TESTS::GOLDEN-TEST-CASE
;;;         :FILE #1="no-trailing-newline.txt"
;;;         :LINE 1
;;;         :INPUT "input 1"
;;;         :OUTPUT "output 1")
;;;      #S(CL-QUIL-TESTS::GOLDEN-TEST-CASE
;;;         :FILE #1#
;;;         :LINE 5
;;;         :INPUT "input 2"
;;;         :OUTPUT "output 2"))
;;;
;;; whereas parsing the file
;;;
;;; ----------- begin with-trailing-newlines.txt ------------
;;; # Input
;;; Input 1
;;;
;;; # Output
;;; Output 1
;;;
;;; # Input
;;; Input 2
;;; # Output
;;; Output 2
;;;
;;; ----------- end with-trailing-newlines.txt ------------
;;;
;;; will return (printf-style newline escapes for brevity, you get the idea)
;;;
;;;     (#S(CL-QUIL-TESTS::GOLDEN-TEST-CASE
;;;         :FILE #1="with-trailing-newlines.txt"
;;;         :LINE 1
;;;         :INPUT "input 1\n"
;;;         :OUTPUT "output 1\n")
;;;      #S(CL-QUIL-TESTS::GOLDEN-TEST-CASE
;;;         :FILE #1#
;;;         :LINE 7
;;;         :INPUT "input 2"
;;;         :OUTPUT "output 2\n"))
;;;
;;;
;;; UPDATING GOLDEN FILES
;;;
;;; If you change the system under test such that it produces new or different output, you'll need
;;; to update the output sections of the associated golden files. The function
;;; UPDATE-GOLDEN-FILE-OUTPUT-SECTIONS does just that. See it's docstring for more info, or have a
;;; look at UPDATE-PRINT-PARSED-PROGRAM-GOLDEN-FILES in printer-tests.lisp for example usage.
;;;
;;; Of course, you are also free to update a golden file with your favorite text editor or by any
;;; other means. Just keep in mind the above comments about trailing newlines.
;;;
;;;
;;; ADDING NEW INPUT/OUTPUT pairs
;;;
;;; You can also use UPDATE-GOLDEN-FILE-OUTPUT-SECTIONS to add new outputs to a golden file without
;;; the need to copy/paste or fiddle with trailing-newline matching. For example, if you add the
;;; following to any golden file, either at the end or just after any existing output section:
;;;
;;;     # Input
;;;     My fresh new input test case
;;;     # Output
;;;
;;; then run
;;;
;;;     (update-golden-file-output-sections
;;;       "path/to/modified/golden/file"
;;;       #'some-function-that-generates-desired-output)
;;;
;;; then the previously-empty output section will be populated with the desired output. Note,
;;; however, that this will update ALL output sections in the file. In general, this is not a
;;; problem since the only sane way to use golden files is to assume that every input/output pair in
;;; the file is to be processed by the same output-generating function. Also note that the trailing
;;; "# Output" is required; otherwise, UPDATE-GOLDEN-FILE-OUTPUT-SECTIONS will fail when attempting
;;; to parse the file.
